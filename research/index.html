	<h2>Exoplanetary System Architectures</h2>
	<p>The arrangement of masses, orbital periods, and mutual inclinations within each exoplanetary system is markedly nonrandom, but describing these patterns is a complex task. I'm leveraging ideas from information theory in order to capture the global architecture of each system, with an eye towards (1) classifying subpopulations of systems, (2) identifying which systems are most likely to host additional undetected planets, and (3) providing better empirical targets for formation models.</p>
